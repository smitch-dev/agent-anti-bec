# 🛡️ Hybrid AI Agent for Business Email Compromise (BEC) Detection

## Project Overview

This project develops and implements a robust, two-tiered Artificial Intelligence agent designed to detect sophisticated Business Email Compromise (BEC) fraud attempts. The agent combines classical Machine Learning (ML) for metadata analysis and Deep Learning (NLP) for content analysis to achieve high detection accuracy.

The project was executed in a three-phase development cycle, covering data simulation, model training, and final agent assembly.

## 🚀 System Architecture

The Anti-BEC Agent operates using a **Hybrid Architecture** composed of two distinct modules:

### 1. Metadata Module (Classical ML - Random Forest)

* **Focus:** Analyzes contextual and structural features of an email, which are often manipulated in BEC attempts.
* **Features:** Sender domain, email hour, email body length, presence of attachments, etc.
* **Model:** Scikit-learn's **Random Forest Classifier**.

### 2. Content Module (Deep Learning NLP - XLM-RoBERTa)

* **Focus:** Analyzes the linguistic content (Subject and Body) to detect subtle psychological cues often found in BEC emails (urgency, confidentiality, authority).
* **Model:** **XLM-RoBERTa-base** (a large, pre-trained transformer model) fine-tuned for binary classification.

The final decision is a weighted average of the probabilities generated by both modules.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites and Setup

This project requires a Python environment managed by Conda.

### 1. Create and Activate the Environment

```bash
conda create -n aibec python=3.9
conda activate aibec
